   <h2>
    My name is Kristen Noble, <br>
    I'm currently studying Web Development at SAIT
   </h2>
   <p>
    I chose to study web development because I enjoy both technology and design. <br>
    I have studied a little bit of Python and Swift before I began learning HTML & CSS <br>
    because I want to develop my own apps someday.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Why SAIT?
   </h3>
   <p>
    I chose SAIT because I have a couple of friends who have graduated from SAIT <br>
    and they enjoy what they do now.
