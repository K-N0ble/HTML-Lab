    <p>
        I grew up in Airdrie, Alberta, a smaller city just outside of Calgary. I attented the same school from kindergarten all the way until I graduated Grade 12. <br>
        Ever since I was little, my family would regularly take trips to the mountains, and that is where I found a love for snowboarding. <br>
        I also have loved many different video games throughout my childhood, which I think largely contributed to my interest in technology and art.<br>

        My Workplace
    </h2>
    <p>
        I began working at London Drugs in August of 2023 in the tech department. I have since also recieved training in the PhotoLab, <br>
        where I get to work with printers, edit pictures, print canvases, and produce a variety of different gifting items. <br>
        I really enjoy working here because it lets me explore my interests and my co-workers have been great! <br>

    <h2>
       Future 
    </h2>
        I am currently learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Swift. <br>
        I hope to further my education in all of these to eventually build personal projects to help develop my portfolio.
