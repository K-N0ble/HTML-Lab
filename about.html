        <p>
            I grew up in Airdrie, Alberta, a smaller city just outside of Calgary. I attented the same school from kindergarten all the way until I graduated Grade 12. <br>
            Ever since I was little, my family would regularly take trips to the mountains, and that is where I found a love for snowboarding. <br>
            I also have loved many different video games throughout my childhood, which I think largely contributed to my interest in technology and art.<br>

            My Workplace

        <p>
            I began working at London Drugs in August of 2023 in the tech department. I have since also recieved training in the PhotoLab, <br>
            where I get to work with printers, edit pictures, print canvases, and produce a variety of different gifting items. <br>
            I really enjoy working here because it lets me explore my interests and my co-workers have been great! <br>

            Future 
         </h2>
         <p>
             I am currently learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Swift. <br>
             I hope to further my education in all of these to eventually build personal projects to help develop my portfolio.
